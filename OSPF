Understanding OSPF or Open Shortest Path First
It is an Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) that dynamically calculates the most efficient path for data packets to travel across an IP network.
It is a link-state protocol that uses Dijkstra's algorithm to build a map of the network and determine the shortest path based on a calculated "cost", which is often related to link bandwidth.
This makes OSPF highly scalable and efficient for use in medium to large networks by ensuring routers have a consistent view of the network topology.
